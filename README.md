# Playlist-Social

Hey There! This is an app for building playlists, and helping others build playlists:
(https://preprod--playlistener.netlify.app/)

Simply create a login, authorize the app to use your spotify account (neeeds to be spotify premium), and start creating / exploring!

You can create and save different playlists with whatever title and description you wish. and search spotify's archives for songs to add. Play them in the app as well by clicking play next to any track

You can also hit the explore page where you can view the playlists others have made. From there you can suggest songs for them to add to their playlists.

Suggestions will show up on the home page under the playlist that recieves them. Just hit the "open saved playlist" tab in the home page and you can see all your saved playlists.
Open the playlist by clicking "view/edit" to see your suggestions or add/remove songs.

NOTE: this app is still in a kind of private beta mode. Because spotify doesnt allow access tokens to just be given out to anyone, for now you have to send me the email associated with your spotify account.
I will then onboard your account to the app's authorized users.
